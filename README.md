# House Price Prediction (ML)

## Description
A Machine learning project to predict house prices using California Housing data.
This is to compare different regression models, all based on the same data and to understand why some models work better than others on this data.

## Dataset
- California Housing Dataset
- Target column: `median housing value`
- features only (categorical column removed)
- Missing values dropped

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression (L2)
- Lasso Regression (L1)
- Random Forest Regressor (comparison)

## Concepts Learned
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Train/Test split
- Regularization (Ridge & Lasso)
- Overfitting vs Underfitting
- Model comparison based on metrics.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## Results Summary
- Linear, Ridge and Lasso did the same.
- Random Forest performed better on this dataset.
- The non-linear relationships were better modeled by Random Forest than by linear models.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates that the choice of a model is determined by the complexity of data.
Linear models are good baseline models for comparison, although other models such as ensemble models can be used.
Random Forest are more effective where the relationships are non-linear.
